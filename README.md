OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
Objective:
  Credit card fraud detection involves identifying unauthorized or suspicious transactions made 
  with credit cards. As the volume of online and digital transactions has increased, so too has 
  the occurrence of fraud. This problem has led to the development of sophisticated detection 
  systems using both traditional statistical methods and advanced machine learning techniques.
STEPS INVOLVED:
   Data Preprocessing
   Feature Engineering
   Model Selection
   Training the Model
   Model Evaluation
   Optimization
   Challenges
Expected Outcome:
   The end product will be a robust fraud detection model that can accurately identify 
   fraudulent transactions, minimizing both false positives and false negatives. The model can 
   be deployed in real-time credit card systems to reduce fraud risk while maintaining a 
   positive user experience.
